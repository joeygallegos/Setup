# About
This repository is mostly for me. This repository is to list out all the equipment, software and things I own.

### Backing up data
All my code is stored in Dropbox and synced between my iPad, iPhone, Laptop and Desktop. If I make a change on my desktop PC I can easily move to remote working on my laptop without any issues.

### Sublime Text Theme
I created [Jam](https://github.com/joeygallegos/Jam), my own custom Sublime Text theme. It's inspired by a design I saw a couple of years back and really liked. I've since moved over to VS Code now, and I no longer use Sublime Text.
